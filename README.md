Raspberry Pi Pico-controlled collection of desk lights

# Overview

After so many ws2812b projects, I had lots of little strips left over.  So, I decided to use them to create some nice 
ambient lighting for my desk. 

# Technical Description
This is a simple ws2812b project using leftover parts from previous projects.  There are 4 short strips daisy-chained
together with a Raspberry Pi Pico as the controller. There are two connections to an external power supply.
